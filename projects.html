      <h2>Inventory Tracker Website</h2>
      <p>
        I developed an inventory tracker website to help businesses manage their stock efficiently. 
        The platform offers real-time inventory updates, a user-friendly interface, and customizable categories
        to organize inventory based on specific needs. Additionally, it features secure local storage to ensure data 
        is always accessible, even offline. This inventory tracker enhances productivity with detailed reporting, multi-user 
        access, and scalable functionality to grow with your business.
